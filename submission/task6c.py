Scenario: Delete a Product
    When I visit the "Home Page"
    And I set the "Name" to "Hat"
    And I press the "Search" button
    Then I should see the message "Success"
    And I should see "A red fedora" in the "Description" field
    When I copy the "Id" field
    And I press the "Clear" button
    And I paste the "Id" field
    And I press the "Delete" button
    Then I should see the message "Product has been Deleted!"
    When I press the "Clear" button
    And I press the "Search" button
    Then I should see the message "Success"
    And I should not see "Hat" in the results
